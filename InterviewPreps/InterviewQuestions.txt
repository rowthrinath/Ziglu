It is used to implement the core identity of class.																			It is used to implement peripheral abilities of class.
A class can only use one abstract class.																					A class can use multiple interface.
If many implementations are of the same kind and use common behavior, then it is superior to use abstract class.			If many implementations only share methods, then it is superior to use Interface.
Abstract class can contain methods, fields, constants, etc.																	Interface can only contain methods .
It can be fully, partially or not implemented.																				It should be fully implemented.
